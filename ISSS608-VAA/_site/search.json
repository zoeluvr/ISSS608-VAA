    "text": "Major Observations\nNine areas are selected according to their geometric location, which are, to be specific, north region, south region, central region, west region, east region, north-west region, north-east region, south-west region, and south-east region.\nIn general, the age pyramids of all these nine regions show similar trend that wide in the middle and narrow at two sides, which can be explained that people at middle-age (25-69) are in the major part, and the elderly and the young child account for relatively small proportion. Meanwhile, it can also be achieved that the population of each gender is near, and show similar age distribution. Another matter that needs to be paid attention to is that the population aging is quite serious, which might be a potential threat of the future development.\nAs for each separate region, it is obvious that the population of the eastern part and western part are higher compared with the central part. This is because the central part is the main metropolitan region and it is by natural chiefly commercial. Another interesting thing is that the population of the northern part mainly lies between 30 and 49 years old. This is probably because north Singapore is the newly-built digital distinct, and has many new technology firms, thus providing numerous opportunities for people at relatively young age, therefore resulting in the accumulation of them."

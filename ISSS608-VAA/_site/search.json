To make a 3*3 trellis diagram, first create a calculated field of index, then add the number of columns as a parameter and set current value as 3.\n \n\n\n3.\nCreate the calculated fields “Columns” and “Rows”. Write “IF [index] % [# of Columns] = 0 THEN [# of Columns] ELSE [index] % [# of Columns] END” and “INT(INT([index]-1)/[# of Columns])” in the description of columns and rows respectively.\n \n\n\n4.\nPut “Planning Area” in the columns and add “Columns” and “Rows” in text to see if the area is put in a group of three. After the examination, drag them back.\n\n\n\n5.\nTo separate the population into that of female and male, create a calculated field by using “IIF([Sex]=”Males/Females”,[Population],0)“. Choose”Males” and “Females” in [Sex] part respectively.\n\n\n\n6.\nDrag “Planning Area” to the detail section under the “Mark” and put it in the filter to show different areas.

After that, nine age-sex pyramids are created.\n\n\n\n9.\nTo adjust pyramids’ positions according to their locations (north, south, north-east etc.), right-click the “Planning Area” under the filter and select sort, then the preferable positions can be set manually.\n\n\n\n10.\nClick the arrow besides the Age Group row and select the “Data source order”, sorting in descending.\n\n\n\n11.\nTo hide the number under the rows and columns, right click the number and cancel the selection of “Show Header”.\n\n\n\n12.\nClick “Format” in the tool bar and select “Font” to adjust the font size.\n\n\n\n13.\nRight-click the a specific pyramid and select “Area..” under “Annotate” to add the label manually.\n\n\n\n14.\nThen the age-sex pyramid trellis is completed."

    "text": "Major Observations\nNine areas are selected according to their geometric locations, which are, to be specific, north region, south region, central region, west region, east region, north-west region, north-east region, south-west region, and south-east region. Since the statistics only contain an extremely small population size in some border areas in Singapore (for example, Changi, western islands etc.), the analysis does not take these places into consideration.\nIn general, the age-sex pyramids of all these nine regions show a similar trend that is wide in the middle and narrow at two sides, which can be explained by the data that people in middle age (25-69) are for the major part, and the elderly and the young child account for a relatively small proportion. Meanwhile, it can also be achieved that the population of each gender is near and show similar age distribution. Another issue that needs to be paid attention to is that all these population pyramids are in the constrictive type, which is a common feature of the developed country, representing that the population aging is quite serious, which might be a potential threat to future development.\nAs for each separate region, it is evident that the population of the eastern and western part are higher compared with the central part. This may be caused by central part’s role as a main metropolitan region, where a large number a companies and shopping complexes situate there but less living quarters. Few residences are built here and the existing houses are expensive, therefore the population here is relatively small compared with other regions.\nAnother interesting thing is that the young population of the northern part (Punggol) is much higher than that of the elderly. Its population mainly lies between 30 and 49 years old. This is probably because north Singapore is the newly-built digital distinct, and has many new technology firms, thus providing numerous opportunities for people at relatively young ages, resulting in their accumulation.\nIn summary, the population of Singapore mainly shows a constructive trend, and the aging problem is quite severe. To solve this problem, Singapore government may need to promote policies to encourage births and welcome high quality work forces from other countries."

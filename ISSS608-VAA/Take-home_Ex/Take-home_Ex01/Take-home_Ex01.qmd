|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1\.  | Upload the original file respopagesextod2022.csv into the tableau and rename the table header                                                                                                                    | ![Caption](picture/S_1.png)                                 |
| 2\.  | Open Sheet 1. To make a 3\*3 trellis diagram, first create a calculated field of index, then add the number of columns as a parameter and set current.                                                           | ![Caption](picture/S_2_1.png) ![Caption](picture/S_2_2.png) |
| 3\.  | Create the calculated fields "Columns" and "Rows" separately, and covert them to discrete.                                                                                                                       | ![Caption](picture/S_3_1.png) ![Caption](picture/S_3_2.png) |
| 4\.  | Put "Planning Area" in the columns and add "Columns" and "Rows" in text to see if the area is put in a group of three. After the examination, drag them back.                                                    | ![Caption](picture/S_4.png)                                 |
| 5\.  | To separate the population into that of female and male, create a calculated field by using IIF( ). Choose "Males" and "Females" in \[Sex\] part respectively.                                                   | ![Caption](picture/S_5.png)                                 |
| 6\.  | Drag "Planning Area" to the detail section under the "Mark" and put it in the filter to show different areas. Click "Columns" and "Rows" and choose "Compute Using Planning Area"                                | ![Caption](picture/S_6.png)                                 |
| 7\.  | Put "SUM(Female)" and "SUM(Male)" under Columns and "Age Group" under Rows.                                                                                                                                      | ![Caption](picture/S_7.png)                                 |
| 8\.  | Right-click the Male axis and choose "Edit Axis", then tick the "Reversed" under the "Scope". After that, nine age-sex pyramids are created.                                                                     | ![Caption](picture/S_8.png)                                 |
| 9\.  | To adjust pyramids' positions according to their locations (north, south, north-east etc.), right-click the "Planning Area" under the filter and select sort, then the preferable positions can be set manually. | ![Caption](picture/S_9.png)                                 |
| 10\. | Click the arrow besides the Age Group row and select the "Data source order", sorting in descending.                                                                                                             | ![Caption](picture/S_10.png)                                |
| 11\. | To hide the number under the rows and columns, right click the number and cancel the selection of "Show Header".                                                                                                 | ![Caption](picture/S_11.png)                                |
| 12\. | Click "Format" in the tool bar and select "Font" to adjust the font size.                                                                                                                                        | ![Caption](picture/S_12.png)                                |

## Major Observations

Nine areas are selected according to their geometric location, which are, to be specific, north region, south region, central region, west region, east region, north-west region, north-east region, south-west region, and south-east region.

In general, the age pyramids of all these nine regions show similar trend that wide in the middle and narrow at two sides, which can be explained that people at middle-age (25-69) are in the major part, and the elderly and the young child account for relatively small proportion. Meanwhile, it can also be achieved that the population of each gender is near, and show similar age distribution. Another matter that needs to be paid attention to is that the population aging is quite serious, which might be a potential threat of the future development.

As for each separate region, it is obvious that the population of the eastern part and western part are higher compared with the central part. This is because the central part is the main metropolitan region and it is by natural chiefly commercial. Another interesting thing is that the population of the northern part mainly lies between 30 and 49 years old. This is probably because north Singapore is the newly-built digital distinct, and has many new technology firms, thus providing numerous opportunities for people at relatively young age, therefore resulting in the accumulation of them.
